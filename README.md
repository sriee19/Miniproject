### The main objective :
 
The development of a versatile Financial Data Extractor Tool,
leveraging the OpenAI API and integrated within the Streamlit framework. The
project addresses the critical challenge of labor-intensive and error-prone manual
data extraction in the financial domain. Our tool is designed to automate the
extraction of structured data from a range of financial documents, including bank
statements, cryptography data, and stock inputs.
The methodology involves the creation of a robust system architecture that utilizes
the OpenAI API for Natural Language Processing and a user-friendly interface built
on Streamlit. The tool excels in processing unstructured data, significantly reducing
the manual workload and enhancing data accuracy.
Key findings highlight the tool's effectiveness in converting unstructured financial
data into structured datasets, presenting the potential for substantial time and cost
savings. Challenges encountered during development are discussed, and the
limitations are acknowledged. The Project concludes by proposing future
enhancements to expand language support and improve error handling, underscoring
the transformative potential of this tool in the financial data extraction realm.
